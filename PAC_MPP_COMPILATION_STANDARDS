PaC MPP COMPILATION STANDARDS
=============================

== Register Use:

  * Register A is used for function return values and intermediate values. It does not have to be preserved.
  * Register X is used to store the previous location of SP at the start of a function. This must be preserved.
  * Register Y is used to store the top of the local variable stack. This must be preserved.
  * Registers I and J are used for indirect array access.

== Stack Structure and Function call-run-return flow:

SP Y LocalVar3
     LocalVar2
     LocalVar1
     Argument2
     Argument1
X    PreviousY
     PreviousX
     Return PC

  * caller sets argument values at SP-4..SP-4-n
  * JSR to function puts the Return PC onto the stack
  * Push the current value of X to the stack
  * Push the current value of Y to the stack
  * Set the value of X to the current value of SP
  * Subtract the required amount of local memory from SP
  * Set Y to SP (this allows for SP to change while keeping a reference to the top of the local vars.

  * Function runs <<State of stack at this point shown above>>

  * Put the return value of the function onto A
  * Set SP back to value of X
  * Pop Y from the stack to return it to its original value
  * Pop X from the stack to return it to its original value
  * Pop PC from the stack to return to caller.
