PaC MP+ Compiler
===============

Usage:
  $ mppc <input> [options]



** Please note that the PaC MP+ Compiler is still a work in progress, so not all of the language constructs have been implemented yet. Thus the compiler is not really useable at this point, and will not officially be until version 1.0 is released. **


Dependencies
------------

All dependencies are references in the Gemfile. These can be installed/update using budler:
$ bundle install


The MP+ Compiler requires ruby >= 1.9. However, if building the lexer, ruby 1.8.7 will also be needed (see build instructions).


The build script also supports removing all trailing whitespace using WStrip available from:
$ gem install wstrip


Build Instructions
------------------

A build script is included which is meant to build the entire compiler. The binaries will be placed in bin/. Unfortunately, the rex gem is outdated and requires ruby 1.8.7 and thus must be build seperately.
  To build the lexer:
    $ /bin/bash --login
    $ rvm use 1.8.7
    $ rex src/mpp_lexer.rex -o bin/mpp_lexer.rb
