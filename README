PaC MP+ Compiler
===============

Usage:
  $ mppc <input> [options]



** Please note that the PaC MP+ Compiler is still a work in progress, so not all of the language constructs have been implemented yet. Thus the compiler is not really useable at this point, and will not officially be until version 1.0 is released. **


Dependencies
------------

The PaC MP+ Compiler requires that both the Rex and Racc rubygems be installed. To do so use the below command:
$ gem install rex && gem install racc

The MP+ Compiler requires ruby >= 1.9. However, if building the lexer, ruby 1.8.7 will also be needed (see build instructions).

To run the testing suites, the test-unit gem must be installed:
$ gem install test-unit

The build script also supports removing all trailing whitespace using WStrip available from:
git@github.com:melari/wstrip.git


Build Instructions
------------------

A build script is included which is meant to build the entire compiler. The binaries will be placed in bin/. Unfortunately, the rex gem is outdated and requires ruby 1.8.7 and thus must be build seperately.
  To build the lexer:
    $ /bin/bash --login
    $ rvm use 1.8.7
    $ rex src/mpp_lexer.rex -o bin/mpp_lexer.rb
